## The `sort()` method in JavaScript

it is used to sort the elements of an array in place. It arranges the elements in ascending order by default, which means that the smallest value will be at the beginning of the array and the largest value will be at the end.

In the provided code, the `sort()` method is used to sort two different arrays: owners and num.

For the owners array, which contains strings representing names, the `sort()` method arranges the names in alphabetical order. This is because the `sort()` method performs a lexicographic sort on strings, which means it compares the characters of the strings based on their Unicode values. As a result, the names are sorted in ascending alphabetical order: "Adam", "Jonas", "Obi", "Zach".

For the num array, which contains numbers, the `sort()` method also arranges the numbers in ascending order. However, there is a caveat when sorting numbers using the `sort()` method. By default, the `sort()` method treats the elements as strings and performs a lexicographic sort. This can lead to unexpected results when sorting numbers.

In the provided code, the num array contains both positive and negative numbers. When sorting numbers, the `sort()` method compares the numbers as strings. This means that negative numbers will be sorted before positive numbers, regardless of their magnitude. For example, -130 will come before 200 in the sorted array.

To overcome this issue, a comparison function can be provided as an argument to the `sort()` method. This comparison function determines the sorting order based on the return value it provides. If the return value is negative, the order of the elements will be switched. If the return value is positive or zero, the order of the elements will remain the same.

The code snippet provides some examples of how the comparison function works. For example, when comparing 200 and 450, the result is -250, which is negative. This means that the positions of the elements will be switched during the sorting process. On the other hand, when comparing 450 and 200, the result is 250, which is positive. This means that the positions of the elements will remain the same.

In summary, the `sort()` method is used to sort arrays in JavaScript. It arranges the elements in ascending order by default, but when sorting numbers, it treats them as strings, which can lead to unexpected results. To overcome this, a comparison function can be provided to customize the sorting order based on specific criteria.

## More on the sort method

The compare function in the `sort()` method is used to determine the order of the elements in the array. It does this by comparing pairs of elements (`a` and `b`).

The function should return a value based on the comparison of `a` and `b`. This value determines the order of `a` and `b` in the sorted array.

Negative value: If the function returns a negative value, it means `a` should come before `b` in the sorted array. This is typically achieved by subtracting `b` from `a` in the function when you want to sort in ascending order.

The `sort()` method in JavaScript can take one optional parameter: a compare function. This function is used to determine the order in which elements should be sorted.

Here's the syntax of the sort() method with the compare function:

```javascript
function compareFunction(a, b) {
  if (a is less than b by some ordering criterion) {
    return -1;
  }
  if (a is greater than b by the ordering criterion) {
    return 1;
  }
  // a must be equal to b
  return 0;
}
array.sort(compareFunction)
```

The compare function in the `sort()` method is used to determine the order of the elements in the array. It does this by comparing pairs of elements (`a` and `b`).

The function should return a value based on the comparison of `a` and `b`. This value determines the order of `a` and `b` in the sorted array.

- Negative value: If the function returns a negative value, it means a should come before b in the sorted array. This is typically achieved by subtracting b from a in the function when you want to sort in ascending order.

```javascript
function compare(a, b) {
  return a - b; // will return a negative value if a < b
}
```

- Positive value: If the function returns a positive value, it means a should come after b in the sorted array. This is typically achieved by subtracting a from b in the function when you want to sort in descending order.

```javascript
function compare(a, b) {
  return b - a; // will return a positive value if a < b
}
```

- Zero: If the function returns zero, it means a and b are equal and their relative order in the sorted array does not matter. When the compare function returns zero, it leaves the order of a and b unchanged with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all different elements.

```javascript
function compare(a, b) {
  return a - b; // will return 0 if a == b
}
```

> N.B The value returned by the compare function determines the order of the elements in the sorted array.
